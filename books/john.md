## The Word Became Flesh
`1` In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. `2` He was with God in the beginning. `3` Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. `4` In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. `5` The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.
